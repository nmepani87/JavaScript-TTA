 <h3>Pizza Menu</h3>
 <p>In this project, I created a menu for ordering a pizza. It has a a few things that are customisable and using that choosen information it outputs a price and list from picked items as a receipt.</p>
 
  <h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h3>
 <p>In this project, I created the Tic-Tac-Toe game. In here the user plays against the computer and if ends in a draw it goes to 'sudden death'. Customised sounds are for various events too.</p>
